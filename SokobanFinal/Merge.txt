Most of our changes were new ideas instead of simple merges since we started from scratch! 
(So there is more explanation in changes.txt)

1. Our implementations were pretty different and we decided to start from scratch by using arraylists.
	We discarded the use of ILists since traversing through arraylists was much simpler and easier
	if we wanted to find a position, for example. Also most of our utils use array lists which, again, 
	was much easier to use.

2. We also decided to switch to using posns, which we did not before, because that would be able to keep 
	track of positioning as well. We got this idea from the examples we saw from the sokoban part 1 
	review assignment. This was much easier than counting columns and rows and attempting
	to keep track of it.

3. Something that we both kept was keeping the ICell and AICell structure since it allowed us 
	to easily implement a new tile, like the hole.

4. We also decided to use function-objects to help with movement since it would be able to 
	visit all the types of cells easily.
	
5. We kept SokobanGame and SokobanWorld to distinguish the game logic from the user input because 
	it made the code a lot more readable and understandable.
